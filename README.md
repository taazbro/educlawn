# EduClawn

`EduClawn` is a local-first open-source education platform for students and teachers.

It combines:

- a desktop app that behaves like normal software
- a reusable project engine for building cited local projects
- a bounded classroom agent system for teachers and students
- a preserved legacy MLK experience in `Legacy_of_Justice.html`

The current product direction is:

- `EduClawn OS`: the school-safe agent operating system
- `EduClawn Studio`: the local project engine and studio UI

This repo intentionally keeps the original `Legacy_of_Justice.html` as a preserved artifact and first template seed. It is not deleted.

## What The Product Does

Students and teachers can:

- create projects from typed manifests and templates
- upload local documents and classroom evidence
- extract and search evidence locally
- generate provenance-backed project artifacts
- connect preferred cloud AI providers with local encrypted profiles
- run bounded local agents with approval gates
- compile projects into multiple export formats
- use the desktop app without running terminal commands every time

## Main Product Layers

### 1. EduClawn OS

### Provider AI Control Plane

- local encrypted AI provider profiles stored inside the EduClawn workspace
- `user-key` mode for bring-your-own API access
- `managed-subscription` mode for locally managed provider seats that EduClawn agents can use on behalf of the classroom workflow
- supported providers:
  - OpenAI
  - Anthropic
  - Google Gemini
  - Groq
  - Mistral
  - Cohere
  - xAI
- supported provider tasks:
  - research
  - assignments
  - feedback
  - planning
  - review
  - export
  - classroom

Provider profiles can be used in three places:

- project manifests through `provider-ai` runtime mode
- classroom assignments through `provider-ai` runtime mode
- bounded classroom agents through an optional provider override

## Desktop Use

If you want to use it like normal software, use the packaged desktop app.

Fastest paths:

- macOS packaged app: open `desktop/release/mac-arm64/EduClawn.app`
- macOS repo copy: double-click `Open-EduClawn.command`
- Windows repo copy: run `Open-EduClawn.bat`
- contributor setup: run `scripts/setup-local.sh` or `scripts/setup-local.ps1`

Artifacts produced by the desktop packaging flow include:

- `desktop/release/mac-arm64/EduClawn.app` from `npm run pack`
- `.dmg` and `.zip` artifacts from `npm run dist:mac`
- Windows installer artifacts from `npm run dist:win`
- Linux package artifacts from `npm run dist:linux`

The desktop app starts the bundled backend automatically and serves the studio locally at `/desktop/`. Users do not need to run the backend and frontend manually to use the packaged app.

For local macOS packaging without Apple credentials, the desktop build wrapper automatically disables hardened runtime so the generated `.app` remains usable on the builder machine. Signed release builds still keep the notarization-ready path.

## One-Step Local Setup

If you are running from the repo instead of a packaged installer:

### macOS / Linux

```bash
./scripts/setup-local.sh
./scripts/start-desktop.sh
```

Or double-click:

- `Install-EduClawn.command`
- `Open-EduClawn.command`

### Windows

Run:

- `Install-EduClawn.bat`
- `Open-EduClawn.bat`

Or use PowerShell directly:

```powershell
.\scripts\setup-local.ps1
.\scripts\start-desktop.ps1
```

Environment check helpers:

- `scripts/doctor.sh`
- `scripts/doctor.ps1`

## Export Formats

Projects can be exported as:

- static site
- React app scaffold
- PDF report
- rubric report
- `.cpsbundle` project bundle

## Local Modes

- `no-llm`: deterministic local generation and scoring
- `local-llm`: optional local model refinement through an Ollama-compatible endpoint
- `provider-ai`: uses a connected provider profile for cloud-backed research, assignments, feedback, and classroom assistance

If no local LLM is available, the platform falls back to deterministic local behavior.

If `provider-ai` is selected but no provider profile is attached, EduClawn keeps the workflow safe and falls back to deterministic local behavior until a profile is connected.

## AI Provider Setup

Use the `AI` page in the desktop or web UI to:

- add a provider profile
- choose `user-key` or `managed-subscription`
- select a default model
- optionally set a custom base URL when the provider supports it
- test the connection
- inspect recent provider-backed usage

The backend stores provider secrets encrypted at rest inside the local workspace using the EduClawn security secret. The raw API keys are not exposed back through the API after profile creation.

## Repository Structure

- `backend/`: FastAPI backend, agents, security, ingestion, exports, analytics
- `frontend/`: React + TypeScript studio UI
- `desktop/`: Electron shell, packaging config, release assets
- `docs/`: template, plugin, and EduClawn docs
- `community/`: sample projects and community packs
- `studio/`: starter manifests and template assets
- `educlawn/`: EduClawn example manifests
- `Legacy_of_Justice.html`: preserved original standalone MLK experience

## Run In Developer Mode

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
uv sync
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.

## Run The Desktop Shell From Source

```bash
cd desktop
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you want the shortest repo path, use `./scripts/start-desktop.sh` or `.\scripts\start-desktop.ps1` instead.

## Package The Desktop App

```bash
cd desktop
npm run pack
```

Platform-targeted packaging commands:

```bash
cd desktop
npm run dist:mac
npm run dist:win
npm run dist:linux
```

## Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Then open:

- studio UI: `http://127.0.0.1:5173`
- backend API: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- preserved legacy page: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/legacy`

## EduClawn Security Model

EduClawn is intentionally not a general unrestricted agent.

It is built as bounded educational orchestration:

- no unrestricted shell execution
- no silent external messaging
- no uncontrolled browser automation
- no hidden destructive filesystem actions
- no sensitive classroom action without approval and audit coverage

See `docs/EDUCLAWN.md` for the detailed contract.

## Templates

Templates in the studio include examples such as:

- MLK Legacy Lab
- Research Portfolio
- Civic Campaign Simulator
- Museum Exhibit Site
- Lesson Module
- Documentary Story Project
- science-fair style flows
- debate prep flows
- reading intervention flows

## Project Manifest Example

```yaml
version: "1.0"
title: Neighborhood Memory Archive
summary: A locally built historical project
topic: Neighborhood memory and public history
audience: Middle and high school students
template_id: documentary-story
local_mode: no-llm
goals:
  - Explain the issue
  - Curate source evidence
  - Build an interactive local project
rubric:
  - Evidence Quality
  - Clarity
  - Audience Fit
```

## Admin Access

Default local admin credentials:

- username: `admin`
- password: `mlk-admin-demo`

Admin surfaces include:

- scheduler state
- benchmark reporting
- experiment metrics
- workflow orchestration
- older MLK intelligence admin flows

## Important Environment Variables

Useful backend overrides:

- `EDUCLAWN_DATABASE_URL`
- `EDUCLAWN_DB_PATH`
- `EDUCLAWN_ADMIN_USERNAME`
- `EDUCLAWN_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- `EDUCLAWN_AUTH_SECRET`
- `EDUCLAWN_WORKFLOW_SCHEDULER_ENABLED`
- `EDUCLAWN_ETL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`
- `EDUCLAWN_RETRAIN_INTERVAL_SECONDS`
- `EDUCLAWN_BENCHMARK_INTERVAL_SECONDS`
- `EDUCLAWN_STUDIO_ROOT`
- `EDUCLAWN_STUDIO_TEMPLATE_DIR`
- `EDUCLAWN_COMMUNITY_ROOT`
- `EDUCLAWN_LOCAL_LLM_MODEL`
- `EDUCLAWN_LOCAL_LLM_BASE_URL`
- `EDUCLAWN_MODEL_CACHE_DIR`
- `EDUCLAWN_SECURITY_SECRET`
- `EDUCLAWN_EDU_MATERIAL_MAX_BYTES`

Legacy `MLK_*` aliases are still accepted for backward compatibility.

## Packaging, Signing, And Releases

The desktop release pipeline now includes:

- macOS packaging
- Windows packaging configuration
- Linux packaging configuration
- GitHub Actions workflow for desktop release builds
- updater metadata publishing configuration

Files to inspect:

- `desktop/README.md`
- `desktop/signing.env.example`
- `.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml`

For full macOS public distribution you still need real credentials:

- `CSC_LINK`
- `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_ID`
- `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`
- `GH_TOKEN`

Without those, local builds remain ad-hoc signed and not notarized.

## Open Source

- code license: `Apache-2.0`
- educational content contributions: `CC-BY` or `CC-BY-SA` recommended

## Contributing And SDK Docs

- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `docs/TEMPLATE_SDK.md`

- `desktop/README.md`

## Verification

The current repo state has been validated with:

- `cd backend && uv run pytest`
- `cd frontend && npm run build`
- `cd desktop && npm run pack`

The packaged macOS app was also smoke-tested against:

- `/health`
- `/desktop/`
- `/api/v1/studio/system/status`

## Legacy Note

`Legacy_of_Justice.html` is still preserved in this repository and still served by the platform. It remains available as a historical standalone artifact and template seed.
